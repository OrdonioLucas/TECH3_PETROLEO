Oil Price Variation Analysis
Welcome to Tech 66 Group's ðŸŽ‰ Oil Price Variation Analysis, where we use the IPEA database as the primary data source to examine the evolution of oil prices since 1987.
In this analysis, we will explore the data broadly, understanding the economic and crisis-related factors that have led to significant variations over time.
Finally, we will provide a machine learning model capable of predicting oil prices for the next 7 days based on the latest data available from the IPEA website.
